    "#### Q3. What is abc module in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sol. The 'abc' module in python stands for 'Abstract Base Classes', It is a built-in modulw that provides the infrastructure for defining abstract base classes(ABCs). Abstact base classes are classes that cannot be instantiated directly but serves as a blueprint for other classes. They define a common interface or set of methods that subclasses are expected to implement. The 'abc' module provide tools for creating abstract base classes and enforcing their usage inthe inheritance hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The 'abc' module is used for the following purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Defining Abstract Base Classes: The 'abc' module provide the 'abc' class,which can be used as a base class for creating abstract base classes. Subclasses of 'ABC' can define abstract methods using '@abstractmethod' decorator. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Enforcing Interface Contracts: Abstract base classes define a contract or set of methods that subclasses must implement. By defining abstract method in the base class, the 'abc' module ensures that any subclass that claims to implement the abstract base class must provide the required methodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Type Checking and Duck Typing: Abstract base classes can be used for type checking and to ensure that object adhere to a specific interface. By using abstract base classes as type hints or function annotations, developers can indicate that a parameter or return value should be an instance of a specific abstract base class or its subclasses. This allows for better code clarity, documentation, and type safety.\n",
